# 🚧 Personal Portfolio – In Progress 🚧

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio** repository! This is a work in progress where I’m building a modern, responsive, and interactive website to showcase my projects, skills, and experience.

## 📌 About This Project

This portfolio will include:
- A clean and accessible design
- Project highlights with links and previews
- Skills and technologies I work with
- A brief about me section
- Contact form and social media links

It’s built using:
- ⚛️ React.js
- 🎨 CSS Modules / Tailwind 
- 🌐 Deployed via GitHub Pages / Vercel *(TBD)*

## 📅 Current Status

> 🛠️ **Under Development**  
> The layout and content are still being built. Sections like Projects and Contact may be incomplete or hidden for now.

## 🧠 Goals

- Improve UI/UX design
- Add animations and smooth transitions
- Make it fully responsive
- Deploy with custom domain


## 🚀 Live Demo

**Coming Soon...**
